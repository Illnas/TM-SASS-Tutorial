Traversy Media SASS Tutorial

One more tutorial for SASS done, and it's file saved to Github. A lot easier now to follow up through tutorial, especially
since I don't have this fear from "variables" XD  Gonna use SASS for Daily UI challenges and pure CSS from JS projects
and finish up React tutorial from FCC, which I did finish previously, but now I am going to repeat it. 

Nothing much here, just being proud of being able to keep up with tutorials. 


P.S. Link to the YT tutorial:  https://github.com/Illnas/TM-SASS-Tutorial.git
